# \< dotGuide /\>

[dotGuide](https://readme-c72e5.web.app/) is an amazing tool to help educators, organizations, individuals, and groups alike.

Have you ever remembered that one time you wrote code that solve the exact problem you're encountering right now, but you can't remember which repo it's in, which file, or which branch?

No more wasting time and searching on SO for a quick fix!

dotGuide has you covered with side-by-side comparison with code and markdown.
## How it works

Add as many files to a "Guide" as you want, each one comes with its own accompanying markdown to help explain what's going on.

Instead of importing your whole repo, or even your whole files, feel free to copy and paste over only what you need.

Need to explain how a vertical slice works? Bring it in in one file or in several.

Need to really zero in on what your hooks are doing in your React project? Explain away.
